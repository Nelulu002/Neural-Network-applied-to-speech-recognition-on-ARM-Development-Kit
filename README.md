# Neural-Network-applied-to-speech-recognition-on-ARM-Development-Kit
This project investigates the application of artificial neural networks in speech recognition and demonstrates the deployment of the trained model on an ARM Development Kit. The ARM-based platform serves as an embedded system to capture, process, and classify speech signals, enabling real-time recognition capabilities.
